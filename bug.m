In Objective-C, a common yet subtle issue arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with regard to object ownership and the interplay between retain counts and autorelease pools.  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    NSLog (@"MyClass deallocated");
    [super dealloc];
}
@end

int main() {
    @autoreleasepool {
        MyClass *myObject = [[MyClass alloc] init];
        myObject.myString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString: @"Hello"];
        // ... some operations ...
    }
    return 0;
}
```

The problem lies in the fact that `myString` is a strong property.  When the `autoreleasepool` ends, `myObject` is deallocated. However, `myString` still has a retain count of 1 (itâ€™s strongly referenced by `myObject`).  The autorelease pool drains, and `myString` is also deallocated, but not at the same time as `myObject`.  This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes later, particularly if you attempt to use `myString` after `myObject` has been released.
